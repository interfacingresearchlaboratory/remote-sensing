GlObal geOreferenced Database of Dams GOOD2 Version 1
 
This is a global database of dams developed by digitising visible dams in Google Earth. The database has been developed for WaterWorld (www.policysupport.org/waterworld). We have used the database to examine hydrological inputs to these dams and the impacts of climate and land use change in their upstream catchments. It is made available to the user community in raw and unfinished form in the hope that others will contribute to its development so that it will grow in use and utility.
